                Pantheon is a bi-annual inter-college fest organised by RNS
                Institute of Technology that is a source of pride for both
                students and the Cultural Activity Team. The term Pantheon
                refers to the collective deities of a religion, and it is safe
                to say that it lives up to its name. It&apos;s our enthralling
                cultural festival, a celebration of diversity and innovation!
                Our festival is an enticing display of many customs, art forms,
                and cultural expressions that combine to offer an immersive
                experience for all attendees. Many hours are spent preparing and
                organising the festival, but the end result is well worth it.
                Every time, Pantheon draws a crowd of around 6000 people and
                never fails to impress.
